pasdroid - An open source implementation of Password Maker for the
Android platform, written in Java

That said, this software is in an early stage of development, and I would 
not recommend that you install it just yet. Currently, the build files are
Eclipse environment specific. Once I'm comfortable that the code will not 
blow anything up, and everything is relatively clean, I'll upload an ant 
file for general development purposes.
